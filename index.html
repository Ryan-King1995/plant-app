                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Apply a balanced fertiliser and mulch in late winter or early spring and again in early summer.  Tie new canes into supports and deadhead after the first flush to encourage reblooming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> Deadhead spent blooms throughout the season.  In winter, prune side shoots back to four healthy buds and tie in long stems, cutting just above outward‑facing buds for good shape.</p>

                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Water regularly and feed weekly in summer with a high‑potash fertiliser.  Mulch or place stones over the root area to keep it cool.  Prune according to the plant’s pruning group.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> Pruning depends on the clematis group: early‑flowering types are lightly trimmed after flowering; large‑flowered hybrids are pruned in late winter and again after the first flush; late‑flowering varieties are cut back hard in late winter.</p>

                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Water during dry spells and mulch to conserve moisture.  Lightly prune after flowering (pruning group 8) and protect buds from frost.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> Carry out major pruning just after flowering or in late February; severe cuts removing up to one‑third of the plant help rejuvenate but may reduce next season’s blooms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Once established, lavateras are fairly drought tolerant and rarely need fertiliser.  Lightly tidy plants in autumn and cut back hard in late spring for sub‑shrubs; herbaceous species are cut down in winter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> After flowering, tidy plants.  In late spring cut sub‑shrubs back to strong shoots; herbaceous lavateras should be cut to the ground in winter.</p>

                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Water regularly, particularly when grown in full sun.  A light compost mulch is appreciated but avoid heavy fertiliser.  Deadhead to extend blooming, cut stems back after flowering and divide clumps every 3–4 years.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> Remove spent flower spikes and tidy leaves; cut back stems after flowering and divide clumps every few years to maintain vigour.</p>

                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Medium to bright indirect light in a cool spot (10–21°C). Avoid direct sun and dry air.</p>
                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Water when the top centimetre of compost dries out and allow excess water to drain. Mist regularly or stand the pot on pebbles in water to increase humidity. Feed lightly during the growing season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> Trim any long or straggly stems to keep the plant tidy and remove discoloured leaves. Repot or refresh the compost every couple of years.</p>

                <h3>Dieffenbachia compacta</h3>
                <div class="details">
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Bright, indirect light; avoid direct sun. Use a fertile, well‑draining potting mix rich in peat or coir and keep away from cold drafts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Care:</strong> Water when the top two centimetres of soil feel dry, providing regular moisture but never allowing the soil to become waterlogged. Average household temperatures and humidity are sufficient, although slightly higher humidity is appreciated. Feed every four to six weeks in the growing season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post‑season:</strong> Remove yellowing leaves and wipe dust from foliage. Repot when the plant outgrows its pot and trim tall stems to encourage bushier growth.</p>
